### [Bypass WiFi Anti-Tethering (TTL /HL=1)](https://github.com/xiv3r/anti-tethering-bypasser)

</summary></h1>

<h4 align="center">
 
   Wireless Sharing Protection (anti-tethering) is a mechanism employed by wisp carriers to restrict tethering or hotspot sharing on wifi users by modifying the interface broadcast ttl value to 1 hops. To circumvent these restrictions, iptables can be utilized to modify network traffic characteristics, allowing users to bypass wireless sharing protection (anti-tethering) effectively.

<h1 align="center"> Using NFTABLES </h1>

To achieve the setup where incoming packets with TTL=1 on the wlan0 interface are modified to have TTL=64 and forwarded to the eth0 interface, and the outgoing packets are modified with TTL=64 when sent back from eth0 to wlan0, you can configure nftables as follows:

# Setup
> [!Note]
> Connect your Router/PC to Internet for Installation.
> Configure your router to Extender/Repeater Mode.
> Openwrt iptables `NAT POSTROUTING`  doesn't work properly on version 1.8.7.
> Applicable only for openwrt router, linux and rooted phones.
> Take note that the `wlan0` is your `ISP` and the destination is `eth0/LAN`.
> Check your interfaces before proceeding to auto install otherwise if doesn't match you need to manually edit wlan0 and eth0 to your current interface where the traffic goes on.

# Check nftables existing ruleset

## Explanation

> Prerouting chain: Incoming packets on wlan0 with TTL=1 are changed to TTL=64 before forwarding.

> Postrouting chain: Outgoing packets through wlan0 are set to TTL=64.

> Forward chain: Allows forwarding between wlan0 and eth0 in both directions.
